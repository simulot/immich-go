# Immich-Go: Upload Your Photos to Your Immich Server

**Immich-Go** is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server.

## Key Features:

* **Effortlessly Upload Large Google Photos Takeouts:**  Immich-Go excels at handling the massive archives you download from Google Photos using Google Takeout. It efficiently processes these archives while preserving valuable metadata.
* **Leverage Google Photos Metadata:**  Immich-Go doesn't just upload your photos; it also imports the associated metadata from Google Photos. This includes details like GPS location, date taken, and album information, ensuring your photos stay organized on your Immich server.
* **Flexible Uploads:**  Immich-Go isn't limited to Google Photos. You can upload photos directly from your computer folders, folders tree and ZIP archives.
* **Simple Installation:**  Forget complex setups! Immich-Go doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.
* **Prioritize Quality, Discard Duplicates:**  Immich-Go discards any lower-resolution versions that might be included in Google Photos Takeout, ensuring you have the best possible copies on your Immich server.


## Google Photos Best Practices:

* **Taking Out Your Photos:**
  * Choose the ZIP format when creating your takeout for easier import.
  * Select the largest file size available (50GB) to ensure all your photos are included.
  * It's important to import all the parts of the takeout together, since some data might be spread across multiple files.

* **Importing Your Photos:**
  * If your takeout is in ZIP format, you can import it directly without needing to unzip the files first.
  * For **.tgz** files (compressed tar archives), you'll need to decompress all the files into a single folder before importing. When using the import tool, include the `-google-photos` option.
  * You can remove any unwanted files or folders from your takeout before importing. Immich-go might warn you about missing JSON files, but it should still import your photos successfully.
  * Restarting an interrupted import won't cause any problems and it will resume the import.

Read [here](docs/google-takeout.md) to understand how Google Photos takeout isn't easy to handle.

### Burst detection
Currently the bursts following this schema are detected:
- xxxxx_BURSTnnn.*
- xxxxx_BURSTnnn_COVER.*
- xxxxx.RAW-01.COVER.jpg and xxxxx.RAW-02.ORIGINAL.dng
- xxxxx.RAW-01.MP.COVER.jpg and xxxxx.RAW-02.ORIGINAL.dng
- xxxxxIMG_xxxxx_BURSTyyyymmddhhmmss.jpg and xxxxxIMG_xxxxx_BURSTyyyymmddhhmmss_COVER.jpg (Huawei Nexus 6P)
- yyyymmdd_hhmmss_xxx.jpg (Samsung)

All images must be taken during the same minute.
The COVER image will be the parent image of the stack

### Couple jpg/raw detection
Both images should been taken in the same minute.
The JPG image will be the cover. 

Please open an issue to cover more possibilities.

### Example Usage: uploading a Google photos takeout archive

To illustrate, here's a command importing photos from a Google Photos takeout archive captured between June 1st and June 30th, 2019, while auto-generating albums:

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ upload
-create-albums -google-photos -date=2019-06 ~/Download/takeout-*.zip             
```

## Command `duplicate`

Use this command for analyzing the content of your `immich` server to find any files that share the same file name, the  date of capture, but having different size. 
Before deleting the inferior copies, the system get all albums they belong to, and add the superior copy to them.

### Switches and options:
| **Parameter**              | **Description**                                             | **Default value**       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `-yes`                     | Assume Yes to all questions                                 | `FALSE`                 |
| `-date`                    | Check only assets have a date of capture in the given range | `1850-01-04,2030-01-01` |
| `-ignore-tz-errors <bool>` | Ignore timezone difference when searching for duplicates    | `FALSE`                 |

### Example Usage: clean the `immich` server after having merged a google photo archive and original files

This command examine the immich server content, remove less quality images, and preserve albums.

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ duplicate -yes
```

## Command `stack`

The possibility to stack images has been introduced with `immich` version 1.83. 
Let use it to group burst  and jpg/raw images together.

### Switches and options:
| **Parameter** | **Description**                                             | **Default value**       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `-yes`        | Assume Yes to all questions                                 | `FALSE`                 |
| `-date`       | Check only assets have a date of capture in the given range | `1850-01-04,2030-01-01` |


## Command `tool`

This command introduce command line tools to manipulate your `immich` server

### Sub command `album delete [regexp]`

This command deletes albums that match with the given pattern

#### Switches 
`-yes` Assume Yes to all questions (default: FALSE).<br> 

#### Example

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ tool album delete \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
```
This command deletes all albums created with de pattern YYYY-MM-DD
