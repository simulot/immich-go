# Bulk Uploading to Immich with `immich-go`

Do you have a large collection of photos or extensive Google Photos takeout files to upload in 'immich'?<br>
Are you struggling with Node.js or Docker installation just to upload your photos to 'immich'?

Give a try to the `immich-go` tool.

- import from folder(s).
- import from zipped archives without prior extraction.
- discard duplicate images, based on the file name, and the date of capture.
- import only missing files or better files (an delete the inferior copy from the server).
- import from Google Photos takeout archives:
    - use metadata to bypass file name discrepancies in the archive
    - use metadata to get album real names
    - use date of capture found in the json files
    - create albums based on Google Photos albums or folder names.
- import photos taken within a date range.
- remove duplicated assets, based on the file name, date of capture, and file size
- no installation, no dependencies.

> ⚠️ This an early version, not yet extensively tested<br>
> ⚠️ Keep a backup copy of your files for safety<br>


For insights into the reasoning behind this alternative to `immich-cli`, please read the motivation [here](docs/motivation.md).


# Executing `immich-go`
The `immich-go` program uses the Immich API. Hence it need the server address and a valid API key.


```sh
immich-go -server URL -key KEY -general_options COMMAND -command_options... {files}
```

`-server URL` URL of the Immich service, example http://<your-ip>:2283 or https://your-domain<br>
`-key KEY` A key generated by the user. Uploaded photos will belong to the key's owner.<br>
`-no-colors-log` Remove color codes from logs.<br>
`-log-level` Adjust the log verbosity as follow: (Default OK)
- `ERROR`: Display only errors
- `WARNING`: Same as previous one plus non blocking error
- `OK`: Same as previous plus actions
- `INFO`: Same as previous one plus progressions


## Command `upload`

Use this command for uploading photos and videos from a local directory, a zipped folder or all zip files that google photo takeout procedure has generated.

### Switches and options:
`-album "ALBUM NAME"` Import assets into the Immich album `ALBUM NAME`.<br>
`-device-uuid VALUE` Force the device identification (default $HOSTNAME).<br>
`-dry-run` Preview all actions as they would be done.<br> 
`-delete` Delete local assets after successful upload. <br>
`-create-album-folder <bool>` Generate immich albums after folder names.<br>
`-force-sidecar <bool>` Force sending a .xmp sidecar file beside images. With Google photos date and GPS coordinates are taken from metadata.json files. (default: FALSE).<br>


### Date selection:
Fine-tune import based on specific dates:<br>
`-date YYYY-MM-DD` import photos taken on a particular day.<br>
`-date YYYY-MM` select photos taken during a particular month.<br>
`-date YYYY` select photos taken during a particular year.<br>
`-date YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD` select photos taken within this date range.<br>

### Google photos options:

Specialized options for Google Photos management:
`-google-photos` import from a Google Photos structured archive, recreating corresponding albums.<br>
`-from-album "GP Album"` Create the album in `immich` and import album's assets.<br>
`-create-albums <bool>`  Controls creation of Google Photos albums in Immich (default TRUE). <br>
`-keep-untitled-albums <bool>` Untitled albums are imported into `immich` with the name of the folder as title (default: FALSE).<br>
`-use-album-folder-as-name <bool>` Use the folder's name instead of the album title (default: FALSE).<br>
`-keep-partner <bool>` Specifies inclusion or exclusion of partner-taken photos (default: TRUE).<br>
`-partner-album "partner's album"` import assets from partner into given album.<br>
`-keep-trashed <bool>` Determines whether to import trashed images (default: FALSE).<br>

Read [here](docs/google-takeout.md) to understand how Google Photos takeout isn't easy to handle.

### Example Usage: uploading a Google photos takeout archive

To illustrate, here's a command importing photos from a Google Photos takeout archive captured between June 1st and June 30th, 2019, while auto-generating albums:

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ upload
-create-albums -google-photos -date=2019-06 ~/Download/takeout-*.zip             
```

## Command `duplicate`

Use this command for analyzing the content of your `immich` server to find any files that share the same file name, the  date of capture, but having different size. 
Before deleting the inferior copies, the system get all albums they belong to, and add the superior copy to them.

### Switches and options:
`-yes` Assume Yes to all questions (default: FALSE).<br> 
`-date` Check only assets have a date of capture in the given range. (default: 1850-01-04,2030-01-01)


### Example Usage: clean the `immich` server after having merged a google photo archive and original files

This command examine the immich server content, remove less quality images, and preserve albums.

NOTE: You should disable the dry run mode explicitly.

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ duplicate -dry-run=false
```

## Command `stack`

The possibility to stack images has been introduced with `immich` version 1.83. 
Let use it to group burst  and jpg/raw images together.

### Switches and options:
`-yes` Assume Yes to all questions (default: FALSE).<br> 
`-date` Check only assets have a date of capture in the given range. (default: 1850-01-04,2030-01-01)


### Burst detection
Currently the bursts following this schema are detected:
- xxxxx_BURSTnnn.*
- xxxxx_BURSTnnn_COVER.*

All images must be taken during the same minute.
The COVER image will be the parent image of the stack

### couple jpg/raw detection
Both images should been taken in the same minute.
The JPG image will be the cover. 


Please open an issue to cover more possibilities.
