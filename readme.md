## What Makes Immich-Go Special?

### Simple Installation:
  * Immich-Go doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.
  * Immich-Go can run on either your workstation or a NAS.

### Handles Large Photo Collections:
  * **Upload Large Google Photos Takeouts:** Immich-Go excels at handling massive archives downloaded from Google Photos using Google Takeout. It efficiently processes these archives while preserving valuable metadata like GPS location, capture date, and album information. Read the [best practices](#google-photos-best-practices) below for more information.
  * **Upload Collections:** You can upload photos directly from your computer folders, folder trees, and compressed ZIP archives.
  * **Is Duplicate-aware:** Immich-Go identifies and discards duplicate photos, keeping only the highest-quality version on the server.
  * **Archive Your Immich Server:** Write the content of your Immich server to a folder tree, ready to be archived or migrated to another server.

### Has Many Options:
* Stack burst photos
* Manage coupled RAW and JPEG files, HEIC and JPEG files
* Use tags
* ... and much more

### Runs on Any Platform:
  * Immich-Go is available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. It can run on any platform where the Go language is ported.

## Requirements

* **Immich Server:** You need a running Immich server to use Immich-Go.
  * Prepare the server's URL (http://your-ip:2283 or https://your-domain.tld)
  * Generate an API key for each Immich user (Account settings > API Keys > New API Key).
* **Basic Knowledge of Command Line:** Immich-Go is a command-line tool, so you should be comfortable using a terminal.

## Upgrading from the Original `immich-go`, Version 0.22 and Earlier

This version is a complete rewrite of the original `immich-go` project. It is designed to be more efficient, reliable, and easier to use. It is also more flexible, with more options and features. As a consequence, the command line options have changed. Please refer to the documentation for the new options.

The visible changes are:
- **Adoption of the Linux Convention** for the command line options: use 2 dashes for long options.
- Complete restructuring of the CLI logic:
  - The `upload` command accepts 3 sub-commands: `from-google-photos`, `from-folder`, `from-immich`. This removes all ambiguity from the options.
  - The new `archive` command takes advantage of this sub-command logic. It is possible to archive from a Google Photos takeout, a folder tree, or an Immich server.

The upgrade process consists of installing the new version over the previous one. You can check the version of the installed `immich-go` by running `immich-go --version`.

# The **upload** command:
The **upload** command loads photos and videos from the source designated by the sub-command to the Immich server. 
**Upload** accepts three sub-commands:
  * [from-folder](#from-folder-sub-command) to upload photos from a local folder or a zipped archive
  * [from-google-photos](#from-google-photos-sub-command) to upload photos from a Google Photos takeout archive
  * [from-immich](#from-immich-sub-command) to upload photos from an Immich server to another Immich server

Examples:
```bash
immich-go upload from-folder --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/your/photos
immich-go upload from-google-photos --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/your/takeout-*.zip
```


The **upload** command need the following options to manage the connection with the Immich server:


| **Parameter**        | **Default value** | **Description**                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | :---------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -s, --server         |                   | Immich server address (e.g http://your-ip:2283 or https://your-domain) (**MANDATORY**)                                             |
| -k, --api-key        |                   | API Key (**MANDATORY**)                                                                                                            |

| --client-timeout     |      `5m0s`       | Set server calls timeout                                                                                                           |
| --device-uuid string |   `$LOCALHOST`    | Set a device UUID                                                                                                                  |

| --skip-verify-ssl    |      `FALSE`      | Skip SSL verification                                                                                                              |
| --time-zone          |                   | Override the system time zone (example: Europe/Paris)                                                                              |
| --session-tag        |      `FALSE`      | Tag uploaded photos with a tag "{immich-go}/YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS"                                                                   |
| --tag strings        |                   | Add tags to the imported assets. Can be specified multiple times. Hierarchy is supported using a / separator (e.g. 'tag1/subtag1') |


## **--client-timeout** 
Increase the **--client-timeout** when you have some timeout issues with the server, especialy when uploading large files.

## **--session-tag** 
Thanks to the **--session-tag** option, it's easy to identify all photos uploaded during a session, and remove them if needed.
This tag is formatted as `{immich-go}/YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS`. The tag can be deleted without removing the photos.


# The **archive** command:

The **archive** command writes the content taken from the source given by the sub-command to a folder tree. 
The destination folder isn't wiped out before the operation, so it's possible to add new photos to an existing archive.

The command accepts three sub-commands:
  * [from-folder](#from-folder-sub-command) to create a folder archive from a local folder or a zipped archive
  * [from-google-photos](#from-google-photos-sub-command) to create a folder archive from a Google Photos takeout archive
  * [from-immich](#from-immich-sub-command) to create a folder archive from an Immich server

All photos and videos are sorted by date of capture, following this schema: `Folder/YYYY/YYYY-MM/photo.jpg`.

Here is an example of what your folder structure might look like:

```
Folder/
├── 2022/
│   ├── 2022-01/
│   │   ├── photo01.jpg
│   │   └── photo01.jpg.JSON
│   ├── 2022-02/
│   │   ├── photo02.jpg
│   │   └── photo02.jpg.JSON
│   └── ...
├── 2023/
│   ├── 2023-03/
│   │   ├── photo03.jpg
│   │   └── photo03.jpg.JSON
│   ├── 2023-04/
│   │   ├── photo04.jpg
│   │   └── photo04.jpg.JSON
│   └── ...
├── 2024/
│   ├── 2024-05/
│   │   ├── photo05.jpg
│   │   └── photo05.jpg.JSON
│   ├── 2024-06/
│   │   ├── photo06.jpg
│   │   └── photo06.jpg.JSON
│   └── ...
```

This structure ensures that photos are neatly organized by year and month within the specified folder, making it easy to locate and manage them.
This folder tree is ready to be archived or migrated to another server.

The general syntax is:

```bash
immich-go archive from-sub-command --write-to-folder=folder options 
```

# **from-folder** sub command:

The **from-folder** sub-command processes a folder tree to upload photos to the Immich server.

## Date of capture

The Immich server takes the date of capture from the metadata of the photo, or in the XMP sidecar file if present. 
However, some photos may not have this information.  In this case, Immich-go can infer the date of capture from the filename.

The option `--date-from-name` instructs Immich-go to extract the date of capture from the filename if the date isn't available in the metadata.

Immich-go can extract the date of capture without the help of an external tool such as ExifTool. It supports basic formats .heic, .heif, .jpg, 
.jpeg, .dng, .cr2, .mp4, .mov, .cr3. 

> Note: `--date-from-name` slows down the process because immich-go needs to parse files to check if the capture date is present in the file.

## Google Photos Best Practices:

* **Taking Out Your Photos:**
  * Choose the ZIP format when creating your takeout for easier import.
  * Select the largest file size available (50GB) to minimize the number of archive parts.
  * Download all parts to your computer.

* **Importing Your Photos:**
  * If your takeout is in ZIP format, you can import it directly without needing to unzip the files first.
  * It's important to import all parts of the takeout together, as some data might be spread across multiple files. Use `/path/to/your/files/takeout-*.zip` as the file name.
  * For **.tgz** files (compressed tar archives), you'll need to decompress all the files into a single folder before importing.
  * You can remove any unwanted files or folders from your takeout before importing.
  * Restarting an interrupted import won't cause any problems and will resume where it left off.

* **What if many of my files are not imported?**
  * Verify if all takeout parts have been included in the processing. Have you used the `takeout-*.zip` file name pattern?
  * Sometimes, the takeout result is incomplete. Request another takeout, either for an entire year or in smaller increments.
  * Force the import of files despite missing JSON files using the option `--include-unmatched`.

## Takeout Tag

Immich-Go can tag all imported photos with a takeout tag. The tag is formatted as `{takeout}/takeout-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`. This tag can be used to identify all photos imported from a Google Photos takeout, making it easy to remove them if needed.

## Burst Detection and Management

The system detects burst photos in the following cases:

| Case                | Description                                                                                                                                                          |

# Additional information and best practices

## **XMP** files process

**XMP** files found in source folder are passed to Immich server without any modification. Immich uses them to collect photo's date of capture, tags, description and GPS location.

## Google photos **JSON** files process

Google photos **JSON** files found in source folders are opened by Immich-go to get the album belonging, the date of capture, the GPS location, the favorite status, the partner status, the archive status and the trashed status. This information is used to trigger Immich features.

## Folder archive **JSON** files process

Those files are generated by the **archive** command. Their are used to restore Immich features like album, date of capture, GPS location, rating, tags and archive status.

```json
{
  "fileName": "example.jpg",
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "dateTaken": "2023-10-01T12:34:56Z",
  "description": "A beautiful view of the Golden Gate Bridge.",
  "albums": [
    {
      "title": "San Francisco Trip",
      "description": "Photos from my trip to San Francisco",
    }
  ],
  "tags": [
    {
      "value": "USA/California/San Francisco"
    },
  
  ],
  "rating": 5,
  "trashed": false,
  "archived": false,
  "favorited": true,
  "fromPartner": false
}
```

## Session tags
Immich-go can tag all imported photos with a session tag. The tag is formatted as `{immich-go}/YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS`. This tag can be used to identify all photos imported during a session. This it easy to remove them if needed.


## Banned file list
The following files are excluded automatically:
- `@eaDir/`
- `@__thumb/`
- `SYNOFILE_THUMB_*.*`
- `Lightroom Catalog/`
- `thumbnails/`
- `.DS_Store/`
- `._*.*`
- `.photostructure/`

## Date range

The `--date-range` option allows you to process photos taken within a specific date range. The following date range formats are supported:

| **Parameter**                        | **Description**                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--date-range=YYYY-MM-DD`            | Import photos taken on a specific day.                   |
| `--date-range=YYYY-MM`               | Import photos taken during a specific month of the year. |
| `--date-range=YYYY`                  | Import photos taken during a particular year.            |
| `--date-range=YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD` | Import photos taken between a specific date range        |



# Examples

#### Importing a Google Takeout with Stacking JPEG and RAW

To import a Google Photos takeout and stack JPEG and RAW files together, with the RAW file as the cover, use the following command:

```bash
immich-go upload from-google-photos --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key --manage-raw-jpeg=StackCoverRaw /path/to/your/takeout-*.zip
```

#### Uploading Photos from a Local Folder

To upload photos from a local folder to your Immich server, use the following command:

```bash
immich-go upload from-folder --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/your/photos
```

#### Archiving Photos from Immich Server

To archive photos from your Immich server to a local folder, use the following command:

```bash
immich-go archive from-immich --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key --write-to-folder=/path/to/archive
```

#### Transferring Photos Between Immich Servers

To transfer photos from one Immich server to another, use the following command:

```bash
immich-go upload from-immich --from-server=http://source-ip:2283 --from-api-key=source-api-key --server=http://destination-ip:2283 --api-key=destination-api-key
```

#### Importing Photos with Specific Date Range

To import photos taken within a specific date range from a local folder, use the following command:

```bash
immich-go upload from-folder --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key --exiftool-enabled --date-range=2022-01-01,2022-12-31 /path/to/your/photos
