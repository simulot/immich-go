# Immich-Go: Upload Your Photos to Your Immich Server

**Immich-Go** is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server.

> ⚠️ This is an early version, not yet extensively tested<br>
> ⚠️ Keep a backup copy of your files for safety<br>

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Simple Installation**: No NodeJS or Docker required
- **Multiple Sources**: Upload from Google Photos Takeouts, iCloud, local folders, ZIP archives, and other Immich servers
- **Large Collections**: Successfully handles 100,000+ photos
- **Smart Management**: Duplicate detection, burst photo stacking, RAW+JPEG handling
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Immich-Go
Download the pre-built binary for your system from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go/releases).

### 2. Basic Usage
```bash
# Upload photos from a local folder
immich-go upload from-folder --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/your/photos

# Upload Google Photos takeout
immich-go upload from-google-photos --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/takeout-*.zip

# Archive photos from Immich server
immich-go archive from-immich --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key --write-to-folder=/path/to/archive
```

### 3. Requirements
- A running Immich server with API access
- API key with appropriate permissions ([see full list](docs/installation.md#api-permissions))

> ⚠️ **Breaking Change**: API keys must now include the `asset.copy` and `asset.delete` permissions in addition to previously required permissions. Please update your API keys accordingly.

## 🙈 Skip System Files

- Use `--ban-file` to exclude junk artifacts. Patterns ending with `/` apply to directories (for example, `--ban-file .Spotlight-V100/`), while patterns without the trailing slash apply to individual files (for example, `--ban-file .DS_Store`).
- Immich-Go ships with sensible defaults that already skip common clutter such as `@eaDir/`, `@__thumb/`, `SYNOFILE_THUMB_*.*`, `Lightroom Catalog/`, `thumbnails/`, `.DS_Store`, `/._*`, `.Spotlight-V100/`, `.photostructure/`, and `Recently Deleted/`.
- Add additional patterns as needed to keep uploads focused on real photos. See the [banned files reference](docs/technical.md#banned-files) for details.

## ✨ How immich-go Works

`immich-go` offers a versatile set of commands to handle your photo and video uploads. Whether you're uploading from a simple folder, migrating from a Google Photos Takeout, or transferring assets between Immich servers, the tool provides intelligent features to preserve your metadata and organization.

Here's a brief overview of the main upload commands:

*   **`from-folder`**: The basic command for uploading from any local folder. It can create albums from your directory structure and read XMP sidecar files.
*   **`from-google-photos`**: A powerful command to migrate from a Google Photos Takeout. It intelligently matches photos with their JSON metadata to preserve albums, descriptions, and locations.
*   **`from-immich`**: A server-to-server migration tool that allows you to copy assets between two Immich instances with fine-grained filtering.
*   **`from-picasa`**: A specialized version of `from-folder` that automatically reads `.picasa.ini` files to restore your Picasa album organization.
*   **`from-icloud`**: Another specialized command that handles the complexity of an iCloud Photos takeout, correctly identifying creation dates and album structures from the included CSV files.

### Leveraging Immich's Features

`immich-go` is more than just an uploader; it intelligently interacts with the Immich server to preserve your library's structure:

*   **Albums and Tags**: Automatically creates albums and tags on the server to match your source organization.
*   **Stacking**: Groups related images, like RAW+JPEG pairs or photo bursts, into stacks.
*   **Duplicate Detection**: Avoids re-uploading files that already exist on the server.
*   **Efficient Uploads**: Can pause Immich's background jobs (like thumbnailing) during an upload for better performance.

For a detailed explanation of how each upload command works, please see the [Upload Commands Overview](docs/upload-commands-overview.md).
