release:

  # IDs of the archives to use.
  # Empty means all IDs.
  #
  # Default: [].

  # If set to true, will not auto-publish the release.
  # Note: all GitHub releases start as drafts while artifacts are uploaded.
  # Available only for GitHub and Gitea.

  # Whether to remove an artifact that already exists.
  #
  # Available only for GitHub.
  # This might be a bit expensive (rate-limiting speaking), so it is only done
  # when the upload of an artifact fails with a 422 (which means it already
  # exists in the release).
  # We then grab the list of artifacts from the release, and delete the file
  # that matches the one we're trying to upload.

  # Useful if you want to delay the creation of the tag in the remote.
  # You can create the tag locally, but not push it, and run GoReleaser.
