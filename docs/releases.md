### feat: exclude files based on a pattern

Use the `-exclude-files=PATTERN` to exclude certain files or directories from the upload. Repeat the option for each pattern do you need. The following directories are excluded automatically:
- @eaDir/
- @__thumb/
- SYNOFILE_THUMB_\*.\*
- Lightroom Catalog/
- thumbnails/
- .DS_Store/

Example, the following command excludes any files in directories called backup or draft and any file with name finishing with "copy)" as PXL_20231006_063121958 (another copy).jpg:
```sh
immich-go -sever=xxxxx -key=yyyyy upload -exclude-files=backup/ -exclude-files=draft/ -exclude=copy).*  /path/to/your/files
```

## Release 0.14.0 "A better UI"

This release is focussed the improvement of the user experience. 

### A shiny user interface

```
. _ _  _ _ . _|_     _  _ 
|| | || | ||(_| | ─ (_|(_)
               v dev _)   

```

Working with big database and big takeout files take some time. Users are now informed about the progression of different tasks:

![image](/docs/render1716187129166.gif)

The screen presents number of processed photos, how they have been processes, the messages log, and at the bottom, the progression of the 3 mains tasks.


### A minimalist user interface

This shiny interface can be be disabled for quieter user interface (`-no-ui`).
The progression is visible. All details on operations are listed in the log file.


```

```

### Immich-go runs simultaneously the collect of immich-server's assets and the analysis of the Google takeout

The code has been refactored to run several task simultaneously to animate the progression screen. The program runs now the reading of immich asset and the the takeout analysis in parallel.

### Immich-go now always produces a log file 

The default name for the log file is `immich-go YYYY-MM-DD HH-MI-SS.log`, located in the current directory.

It's possible to give a path and a name to the log file with the option `-log-file=path/to/file.log`. 
If the file file exists already, the new messages will be added to its end.

The log level `OK` is removed.

### Immich-go is published under the AGPL-3.0 license

I chose the same license as the immich project license to release immich-go. 

### Next steps

- Issues closing
- A shiny user interface for the command `duplicate`


## Release 0.13.2

### Fix [[#211](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go/issues/211)]  immich-go appears to retain/cache an API key
Fix the logic for retaining the credential: 

When given, the credentials are saved into the configuration file.
When not given, the credential are read from the configuration file if possible.
 
## Release 0.13.0

### Improvement: [#189](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go/issues/189) Use a configuration file to store server's address and its API key  

The server URL and the API key are now stored into a configuration file (by default $HOME/.immich-go/immich-go.json).
If not provided in the CLI argument, those values are read from the configuration file.

The option `-use-configuration=path/to/config/file` let you specify the configuration file. 

### fix: [#193](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go/issues/193) Flags not being passed to subcommands #193


### Improvement: Better handling of wild cards in path 
`Immich-go` now accepts to handle path like `photos/Holydays*`. This, combined with the `-create-album-folder` will create 
an album per folder Holydays*.

It can handle patterns like : /photo/\*/raw/\*.dmg

### fix: Append Log #182
Log are now appended to the log file


## Release 0.12.0

### fix: #173 [Feature Request:] Set date from file system timestamp
When there is no date of take neither in the file name nor in EXIF data, the photo is uploaded with the file modification date.
This behavior can be changed with the option:
`-when-no-date FILE|NOW` 

## Release 0.11.0

### fix: stack command fails #169 
The immich version 1.95 changed the /asset api endpoint used to during the stack operation.

## Release 0.9.10

### fix: #128 Parenthesis Name Only Error?
Some google photos users have lot of files named .jpg, (1).jpg, (x).jpg. Those names aren't makes immich-server crashing or timeout.
When such files are encountered, they are now uploaded with the name "No Name".

### fix: #125 XMP filenames don't always match what is expected 

For an named ABC.jpg, immich-go will check the presence of a XMP files in the following order

1. ABC.jpg.xmp
2. ABC.xmp
3. ABC.*.xmp

The latest allow the take a XMP file named ABC.RAW.xmp and associate it with the ABC.jpg
Note: when stacking is used, the xmp is visible only withe the cover file (immich-server behavior). 

### fix: flag -create-stacks not honoured

### fix: A lot of images skipped from Google Photos Takeout #68

Improvement for the takeout import. 
- The log indicate with JSON is associated to an file.
- JSON and files are associated by applying successively rules from the most common to the strangest one
   
   Each JSON is checked. JSON is duplicated in albums folder.<br>
   Associated files with the JSON can be found in the JSON's folder, or in the Year photos.<br>

   Once associated and sent to the main program, files are tagged for not been associated with an other one JSON.<br>
   Association is done with the help of a set of matcher functions. Each one implement a rule<br>
   1 JSON can be associated with 1+ files that have a part of their name in common.<br>
   -   the file is named after the JSON name<br>
   -   the file name can be 1 UTF-16 char shorter (🤯) than the JSON name<br>
   -   the file name is longer than 46 UTF-16 chars (🤯) is truncated. But the truncation can creates duplicates,  then a number is added.
   -   if there are several files with same original name, the first instance kept as it is, the next have a a sequence number. File is renamed as IMG_1234(1).JPG and the JSON is renamed as IMG_1234.JPG(1).JSON
   -   of course those rules are likely to collide. They have to be applied from the most common to the least one.<br>
   -   sometimes the file isn't in the same folder than the json... It can be found in Year's photos folder<br>
   The duplicates files (same name, same length in bytes) found in the local source are discarded before been <br>presented to the immich server.
 Release 0.8.8<br>

### fix for #86: unknown time zone Argentina/Buenos_Aires

On some systems, the time zone name is not well recognized.

The new command line option set the time zone used by the program.
`-time-zone=time_zone_name`


## Release 0.8.7

### fix for #82: PM files causing server's bad request 
Android Live photos are delivered as one JPG and a MP files.
MP is the small movie.
The JPG files embeds this movie. 

The Immich server detects live photos without the help of the MP files. Just ignore them.

### Log Improvement

It's always difficult to understand how any file is handled. 

By setting the `-log-level=INFO`, immich-go now produce a comprehensive report on actions done with each files.
Example:
```
...

## Release 0.8.6

### fix for #68: A lot of images skipped from Google Photos Takeout

The Google takeout archive is full of traps. The difficulty is to associate all images with a JSON.
Now more files are now imported. There still few missing files, but they are now listed.

The program now reports how files are handled, or discarded.

```
Upload report:
 53998 scanned files
 53993 handled files
 26937 metadata files
   535 uploaded files on the server
    49 upgraded files on the server
  1540 duplicated files in the input
  8382 files already on the server
    77 discarded files because in folder failed videos
     1 discarded files because of options
 16470 discarded files because server has a better image
     1 files type not supported
     1 errors
     5 files without metadata file
7 files can't be handled
File: Takeout/Google Photos/Photos from 2019/1556189729458-8d2e2d13-bca5-467e-a242-9e4cb238e(1).jpg

        Error , json: cannot unmarshal array into Go struct field GoogleMetaData.title of type string

Done.
```


The plenty of rules for associating image to JSON are somewhat contradictory. I have to rethink the system for applying  
rules from the most common to the strangest ones.

Still lot of work to deliver.

- [doc/google-takeout.md](./google-takeout.mdgoo)
- [doc/motivation.md](./motivation.md)

### Better getAssets handling

### Use-the-new-stacking-feature-to-group-jpg-and-raw-images,-same-for-burst-#45

## Release 0.4.0

### Fix #44: duplicate is not working?

At 1st run of the duplicate command, low quality images are moved to the trash and not deleted as before 1.82.
At next run, the trashed files are still seen as duplicate.
The fix consist in not considering trashed files during duplicate detection


### Fix #39: another problems with Takeout archives

I have reworked the Google takeout import to handle #39 cases. Following cases are now handled:
- normal FILE.jpg.json -> FILE.jpg
- less normal FILE.**jp**.json -> FILE.jpg
- long names truncated FIL.json -> FIL**E**.jpg
- long name with number and truncated VERY-LONG-NAM(150).json -> VERY-LONG-**NAME**(150).jpg
- duplicates names in same folder FILE.JPG(3).json -> **FILE(3)**.JPG
- edited images FILE.JSON -> FILE.JPG and **FILE-edited**.JPG

Also, there are cases where the image JSON's title is totally not related to the JSON name or the asset name.
Images are uploaded with the name found in the JSON's title field.

Thank to @bobokun for sharing details.


## Release 0.3.6
### Fix #40: Error 204 when deleting assets

## Release 0.3.5

### Fix #35: weird name cases in google photos takeout: truncated name or jp.json
Here are some weird cases found in takeout archives

example:
image title: 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋😛😝😜🤪🤨🧐🤓😎🥸🤩🥳😏😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🤬🤯😳🥵🥶.jpg
image file: 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋😛.jpg
json file: 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋.json

example:
image title: PXL_20230809_203449253.LONG_EXPOSURE-02.ORIGINAL.jpg
image file: PXL_20230809_203449253.LONG_EXPOSURE-02.ORIGINA.jpg
json file: PXL_20230809_203449253.LONG_EXPOSURE-02.ORIGIN.json

example:
image title: 05yqt21kruxwwlhhgrwrdyb6chhwszi9bqmzu16w0 2.jpg
image file: 05yqt21kruxwwlhhgrwrdyb6chhwszi9bqmzu16w0 2.jpg
json file: 05yqt21kruxwwlhhgrwrdyb6chhwszi9bqmzu16w0 2.jp.json



### Fix #32: Albums contains album's images and all images having the same name
Once, I have a folder full of JSON files for an album, but it doesn't have any pictures. Instead, the pictures are in a folder organized by years. To fix this, I tried to match the JSON files with the pictures by their names.

The problem is that sometimes pictures have the same name in different years, so it's hard to be sure which picture goes with which JSON file. Because of this, created album contains image found in its folder, but also images having same name, taken in different years.

I decided to remove this feature. Now, if the image isn't found beside the JSON file, the JSON is ignored.


## Release 0.3.2, 0.3.3, 0.3.4
### Fix for #30 panic: time: missing Location in call to Time.In with release Windows_x86_64_0.3.1
Now handle correctly windows' timezone names even on windows.
Umm...

## Release 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
**Refactoring of Google Photo Takeout handling**

The takeout archive has flaws making the import task difficult and and error prone.
I have rewritten this part of the program to fix most of encountered error.

### google photos: can't find image of album #11 
Some image may miss from the album's folder. Those images files are located into the year folder. 
This fix looks for album images in the whole archive.

### photos with same name into the year folder #12 
Iphones and digital cameras produce images with the sequence number of 4 digits. This leads inevitably to have several images with the same number in the the year folder.

Google Photos disambiguates the files name by adding a counter at the end of the image file:
- IMG_3479.JPG
- IMG_3479(1).JPG
- IMG_3479(2).JPG

Surprisingly, matching JSON are named as 
- IMG_3479.JPG.json
- IMG_3479.JPG(1).json
- IMG_3479.JPG(2).json

This special case is now handled.

### Untitled albums are now handled correctly
Untitled albums now are named after the album's folder name.

This address partially the issue #19.

###  can't find the image with title "___", pattern: "___*.*": file does not exist: "___" #21 

The refactoring of the code don't use anymore a file pattern to find files in the archive. 
The image and the JSON file are quite identical, except for duplicate image (see #12) or when the file name is too long (how long is too long?).

Now, the program takes the image name, check if there is a JSON that matches, open it and use the title of the image to name the upload.

If the JSON isn't found, the image is uploaded with it's name in the archive, and with no date. Now all images are uploaded to immich, even when the JSON file is not found.

### MPG files not supported. #20 
Immich-go now accepts the same list of extension as the immich-server. This list is taken from the server source code.

### immich-go detects raw and jpg as duplicates #25 
The duplicate checker now uses the file name, its extension and the date of take to detect duplicates. 
So the system doesn't signal `IMG_3479.JPG` and `IMG_3479.CR2` as duplicate anymore.

### fix duplicate check before uploading #29
The date parsing now takes into account the time zone of the machine (ex: Europe/Paris). This handles correctly summer time and winter time. 
This isn't yet tested on Window or Mac machines.


## Release 0.2.3

- Improvement of duplicate command (issue#13)
  - `-yes` option to assume Yes to all questions
  - `-date` to limit the check to a a given date range
- Accept same type of files than the server (issue#15)

- new feature: add partner's assets to an album. Thanks to @mrwulf.
- fix: albums creation fails sometime

### Release 0.2.2
- improvement of date of capture when there isn't any exif data in the file
    1. test the file name for a date
    1. open the file and search for the date (.jpg, .mp4, .heic, .mov)
    1. if still not found, give the current date

> ⚠️ As of current version v1.77.0, immich fails to get the date of capture of some videos (IPhone), and place the video on the 01/01/1970.
> 
> You can use the -album to keep videos grouped in a same place despite the errors in date.

### Release 0.2.1
- Fix of -album option. uploaded images will be added into the album. Existing images will be added in the album if needed.

### Release 0.2.0
- When uploading from a directory, use the date inferred from the file name as file date.  Immich uses it as date of take. This is useful for images without Exif data.
- `duplicate` command check immich for several version of the same image, same file name, same date of capture
